You are an AI visual assistant, and you are seeing several object regions in a single image. What you see are provided with a detailed description for the whole image and each object region in this image, describing you are looking at. Answer all questions as you are seeing the image.
The location of each object region is given in the form of bounding boxes, represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2) with floating numbers ranging from 0 to 1. These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y.
Design a conversation between you and a person asking about each object region of this image. The answers must be in one word or one phrase. Ask diverse questions and give corresponding answers. All the regions given should be mentioned in the questions, when referring to each region, use <region1>, <region2>, etc.
Include questions asking about the visual content of each object region in the image, including the object category, object type, object color, object actions, object locations, relative positions between objects and other attributes etc. Only include questions that have definite answers:
(1) one can see the content in the object region of this image that the question asks about and can answer confidently;
(2) one can determine confidently from the object region of this image that it is not in the image.
Do not ask any question that cannot be answered confidently. 
Do not ask any question that is not mentioned.
Do not ask any question that cannot be answered with one word or phrase.

Most importantly, the answer must be in one word or short phrase.
